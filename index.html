              <h3> Autonomous Navigation for UGVs, UAVs, AMRs, etc.</h3>
              <p>
                Aid the UGVs (or AMRs) in unknown environments by avoiding obstacles by reacting to it
                very similar to how humans drive instead of using a pre-build map by adding landmarks and executing 
                control plans. This approach does not rely on heavy and expensive sensors, 
                rather simple yet effective stereo depth sensor(s), to generate depth map to be used in obstacle 
                avoidance algorithm. The dependency towards AI is also eliminated by incorporating complex (and iterative) 
                path-planning steps, instead a odometry (or GPS) controls is implemented to simply 
                navigate towards the destination wile avoiding all the obstacles along the way. Works 
                effectively in dynamic environments, as this method do not map the environment at everry step rather react.

            Hi, I‚Äôm Vomsheendhur Raju, but you can call me Vom. Born in Pondicherry, India, I have always had a passion for mechanical engineering and technology. I began my journey at the College of Engineering, DIT, Dehradun,
            before transferring to North Dakota State University (NDSU), Fargo, USA, where I earned my B.S. 
            in Mechanical Engineering in 2016.
            </p>
            <p>
            From March 2017 to January 2020, I worked as a Mechanical Engineer at Malach USA LLP, based in Valley City, North Dakota.
            There, I was responsible for supervising design, machine programming, testing, and quality control processes for sheet metal 
            fabrications, ensuring efficiency and precision at every stage. 
            Additionally, I have valuable Research & Technology (R&T) experience with Bracco, 
            where I contributed to the development of NGI and other advanced engineering projects for interventional cardiologists. 
            This experience broadened my understanding of innovative technologies, control strategies, and their applications in the medical field.
            </p>
            <p>
            Currently, I‚Äôm in the final stages of completing my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at NDSU,
            where my research focuses on developing optimal navigation algorithms for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). 
            My work aims to advance robotics and autonomous systems, particularly in improving the ability of machines 
            to navigate complex environments safely and efficiently. As I close in on completing my Ph.D., 
            I‚Äôm eager to leverage my experience and expertise in robotics, automation, and 
            mechatronics to contribute to groundbreaking projects in advanced technologies.
